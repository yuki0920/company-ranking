# Welcome to Company Ranking Contributing Guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be a valuable addition to the [Company Ranking](https://github.com/yuki0920/company-ranking) repository :sparkles:.

In this guide, you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New Contributor Guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting Started

### Issues

#### Create a New Issue

If you spot a problem with the code or have a feature request, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/yuki0920/company-ranking/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant template.

#### Solve an Issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/yuki0920/company-ranking/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make Changes Locally

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit Your Update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to write a clear and concise commit message.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill in the PR template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes and the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.

### Your PR is Merged!

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the [Company Ranking repository](https://github.com/yuki0920/company-ranking).
